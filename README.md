Watch video's from primevideo.com together in sync! This server facilitates synchronization features using a websocket.

## Setup & run
Make sure your machine runs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 10 or above.

```shell script
> npm install
> npm run start
```

If you'd like to run this server as a continuous background service in a production environment,
use `npm run forever` and set up a reverse proxy with https that points to the PvP server.
